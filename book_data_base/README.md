# üìö BookDatabase: Python Book Collection Manager

A simple, in-memory Python class (`BookDatabase`) designed to manage a personal book collection. It uses a list of dictionaries as its backend and leverages the **`prettytable`** library to display the entire database in a clean, professional-looking Markdown table format suitable for command-line output.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Add** new book entries with comprehensive metadata.
* **View** individual book details using `pprint`.
* **View** the entire collection formatted as a beautiful, sortable table.
* **Update** existing book information selectively.
* **Delete** books from the database by title.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

This project requires Python 3.8+ and two external libraries: `prettytable` and `pprint` (which is standard).

### Prerequisites

You can install the required external library using `pip`:

```bash
pip install prettytable

Usage
Simply copy the BookDatabase class code into a Python file (e.g., book_manager.py) and instantiate the class in your main script.

üìñ Class Structure Overview

Genre	The book's genre.	str
Translator(s)	List of translators (if applicable).	list of str

Finish Reading	Date the book was finished.	str
Edition Number	Book edition (e.g., "1st Edition").	str
Published Year	Year of publication.	int
